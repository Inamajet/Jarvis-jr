# JARVIS Jr. — Design Document

## What it does
JARVIS Jr. is a desk companion robot that wakes up when you clap twice. It has a camera that streams to your phone, an arm that waves, and an LED face that shows expressions.

## Problem it solves
Smart speakers like Alexa just sit there and talk. JARVIS Jr. actually interacts with your room — it waves, looks at things, and responds to you physically.

## How it works
- **Wake up:** Double-clap detected by sound sensor
- **Vision:** ESP32-CAM streams video to your phone over WiFi
- **Arm:** Servo motor waves or points
- **Face:** LED matrix displays eyes and expressions
- **Sound:** Buzzer makes beeps
